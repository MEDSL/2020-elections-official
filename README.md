# 2020-elections-official

This is the MEDSL repository for official precinct returns for 2020 General Election.

 Users can download data by the level of office returns (president, US senate, US house, state, or local levels). For each state that is complete, users can also download all of the precinct-level returns separately in the folders above.

The returns are in progress, and will be updated periodically until completion. The following states and districts are included in the dataset:

## Alabama

Added 02-22-2021. Local data not included at the moment. Overvotes and Undervotes were not reported on offical canvas results so were not verified.

## Alaska

Added 02-23-2021. 

## Arkansas

Added 02-16-2021. Local data not included at the moment.

## Connecticut

Added 02-22-2021. Local data not included at the moment.

There were a small number of discrepancies between our cleaned precinct results and the results from the Secretary of State's website (https://ctemspublic.pcctg.net/#/selectTown). These seem to be from a couple of duplicate rows in the exported data, which we have removed in our cleaned data. This means that for a small number of offices, we will report a slightly lower number of total votes than the results posted online. 

Here are the discrepancies:

For office STATE SENATE district 024, SUSAN CHAPMAN has 823 in our data instead of 827 reported online

For office US HOUSE district 003, MARGARET STREICKER has 6026 in our data instead of 6030 reported online

For office US PRESIDENT, HAWKINS AND WALKER has 7529 in our data instead of 7538 reported online

For office US PRESIDENT, JORGENSEN AND COHEN has 20225 in our data instead of 20230 reported online
